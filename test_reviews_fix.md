# Reviews Functionality Fix - Test Summary

## Fixed Issues âœ…

### 1. API Endpoint URLs Fixed
- **Problem**: Double "api" prefix in URLs (`/api/api/reviews/...`)
- **Solution**: Removed extra `/api` prefix from three API calls:
  - `fetchProductReviews()`: `/reviews/products/${currentProduct.id}/reviews/`
  - `fetchProductRatingStats()`: `/reviews/products/${currentProduct.id}/stats/`
  - `submitReview()`: `/reviews/products/${currentProduct.id}/reviews/`

### 2. Submit Button Visibility Fixed
- **Problem**: Submit button was not properly contained/spaced
- **Solution**: Wrapped button in proper div with `mt-4` margin for better spacing

### 3. Name Field Behavior Fixed
- **Problem**: Name field should be auto-filled and read-only for logged-in users
- **Solution**: 
  - Added watcher to auto-populate name from `user.first_name` + `user.last_name` or `user.username`
  - Made field `readonly` and `disabled` for logged-in users
  - Added gray background styling to indicate read-only state

### 4. Form Validation Updated
- **Problem**: Validation logic was unclear for logged-in vs non-logged-in users
- **Solution**: Simplified to only require rating and comment for logged-in users (name auto-filled)

### 5. Form Reset Behavior Fixed
- **Problem**: Form reset was clearing the user's name
- **Solution**: Preserve user's name when resetting form after successful submission

### 6. CSS Compilation Errors Fixed
- **Problem**: @apply directives causing compilation errors
- **Solution**: Replaced with standard CSS for better compatibility
