# Gig Approval Notifications Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds notifications for when MicroGigPost (gigs) are approved by administrators. When an admin changes a gig's status from 'pending' to 'approved', the user who posted the gig will receive a notification.

## Components Added/Modified

### 1. AdminNotice Model (`base/models.py`)
- Added `'gig_approved'` notification type to `NOTIFICATION_TYPES`
- This allows the system to categorize gig approval notifications

### 2. Notification Function (`base/views.py`)
- Added `create_gig_approved_notification()` function
- Creates notifications with appropriate title and message
- Follows the same pattern as other notification functions

### 3. Django Signals (`base/signals.py`)
- **NEW FILE**: Implements signal handlers for MicroGigPost status changes
- `store_previous_gig_status()`: Pre-save signal to track previous status
- `handle_gig_status_change()`: Post-save signal to detect approval and create notifications
- Includes duplicate prevention and comprehensive logging

### 4. App Configuration (`base/apps.py`)
- Added `ready()` method to import signals when Django starts
- Ensures signals are properly registered

### 5. Test Command (`base/management/commands/test_gig_notifications.py`)
- Django management command for testing the notification system
- Can be run with: `python manage.py test_gig_notifications`

## How It Works

1. **Gig Creation**: User creates a gig with status 'pending'
2. **Admin Review**: Admin reviews the gig in Django admin panel
3. **Status Change**: Admin changes `gig_status` from 'pending' to 'approved'
4. **Signal Trigger**: Django signals detect the status change
5. **Notification Creation**: System creates a notification for the gig owner
6. **User Notification**: User sees the approval notification in their notifications

## Signal Flow

```
MicroGigPost.save() called
    ↓
pre_save signal: store_previous_gig_status()
    ↓ (stores old status)
Model saved with new status
    ↓
post_save signal: handle_gig_status_change()
    ↓ (compares old vs new status)
If pending → approved: create_gig_approved_notification()
    ↓
AdminNotice record created
    ↓
User receives notification
```

## Features

- **Automatic**: No manual intervention needed
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Won't create multiple notifications for the same gig
- **Logging**: Comprehensive console logging for debugging
- **Reference Tracking**: Each notification links to the specific gig
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear, informative notification content

## Testing

1. **Manual Testing**:
   - Create a gig (status will be 'pending')
   - Go to Django admin → MicroGigPost
   - Change the gig's status to 'approved'
   - Check AdminNotice table for new notification

2. **Management Command**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py test_gig_notifications
   ```

3. **Verification Script**:
   ```bash
   python verify_gig_notifications.py
   ```

## Database Migration

If needed, create and apply migrations:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

## Frontend Integration

The notification system is already integrated with the frontend through:
- `useTickets.js` composable handles notification fetching
- Existing notification APIs work with the new notification type
- No frontend changes needed for basic functionality

## Similar Implementations

This follows the same pattern as:
- Mobile recharge approval notifications (`mobile_recharge/signals.py`)
- Order notifications
- Withdrawal notifications

## Troubleshooting

1. **Signals not firing**: Check that `base.signals` is imported in `apps.py`
2. **No notifications created**: Check console logs for error messages
3. **Duplicate notifications**: Reference ID system should prevent this
4. **Testing issues**: Use the management command for isolated testing

## Files Modified

- `base/models.py` - Added notification type
- `base/views.py` - Added notification function
- `base/apps.py` - Added signal import
- `base/signals.py` - NEW: Signal handlers
- `base/management/commands/test_gig_notifications.py` - NEW: Test command

## Future Enhancements

- Email notifications for gig approvals
- Push notifications for mobile app
- Notification preferences for users
- Batch notification processing for multiple approvals
