Notification System Validation Summary
======================================

This script validates all the notification fixes implemented for the production system.

ISSUES FIXED:
1. ✅ Users not receiving withdrawal completion notifications after admin approval
2. ✅ Mobile recharge notifications appearing twice (duplicated)  
3. ✅ Order received notifications not being delivered for cash-on-delivery orders
4. ✅ Unread notification count display using backend APIs instead of frontend calculation
5. ✅ Import and syntax issues in models.py and views.py files

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
